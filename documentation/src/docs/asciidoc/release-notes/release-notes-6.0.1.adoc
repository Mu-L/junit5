[[release-notes-6.0.1-junit-platform]]
=== JUnit Platform

[[release-notes-6.0.1-junit-platform-bug-fixes]]
==== Bug Fixes

* The `jdk.jfr` package is now an optional import when using the `junit-platform-launcher`
  as an OSGi bundle.
* Remove remnants of Java 8 compatibility from User Guide.


[[release-notes-6.0.1-junit-jupiter]]
=== JUnit Jupiter

[[release-notes-6.0.1-junit-jupiter-bug-fixes]]
==== Bug Fixes

* A regression introduced in version 6.0.0 caused an exception when using `@CsvSource` or
  `@CsvFileSource` if the `delimiter` or `delimiterString` attribute was set to `+++#+++`.
  This occurred because `+++#+++` was used as the default comment character without an
  option to change it. To resolve this, a new `commentCharacter` attribute has been added
  to both annotations. Its default value remains `+++#+++`, but it can now be customized
  to avoid conflicts with other control characters.
* Fix `IllegalAccessError` thrown when using the Kotlin-specific `assertDoesNotThrow`
  assertion.
* Stop reporting discovery issues for synthetic methods, particularly in conjunction with
  Kotlin suspend functions.
* Fix support for test methods with the same signature as a package-private methods
  declared in super classes in different packages.

[[release-notes-6.0.1-junit-jupiter-new-features-and-improvements]]
==== New Features and Improvements

* The `@CsvSource` and `@CsvFileSource` annotations now allow specifying
  a custom comment character using the new `commentCharacter` attribute.
* Improve error message when using `@ParameterizedClass` with field injection and not
  providing enough arguments.
* Allow calling `TypedArgumentConverter` constructor for `@Nullable T` target types
  without having to cast class literals to `Class<@Nullable T>`.


[[release-notes-6.0.1-junit-vintage]]
=== JUnit Vintage

[[release-notes-6.0.1-junit-vintage-new-features-and-improvements]]
==== New Features and Improvements

* Allow disabling the reporting of discovery issues by the JUnit Vintage engine (including
  the one reported for its deprecation) by setting the new
  `junit.vintage.discovery.issue.reporting.enabled` configuration parameter to `false`.
